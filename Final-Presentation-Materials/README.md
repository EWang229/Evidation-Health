This folder contains all materials for our final presentations. The best way to view our final presentation is through the recorded video (titled: “Final_Presentation_Video.mp4”). The slides from this presentation can also be found in this folder in a separate file. 

In addition, we have a poster originally created for an inter collegiate data science capstone event. This poster presents an overview of our project topic, data, methods, results, conclusions, and references.
